1 Add BugID to clang's output.

2 Improve generating of unique ids in clang.
  2.1 Introduce platform-independend hashing
  2.2 Base locations on the semantic model.
  2.3 Impact ID's dependency on paths

3 Implement Tracking Platform
  Tracking platform is a tool which is intended to work with bugs database. 
  It will use SqlAlchemy. 
  
  3.1 Design database schema.
  3.2 Create interface for accessing this database.
  3.2 Tagging of false positive
  3.3 Evolution of number of defects (per category or not).

4 Improve scan-view (should use Tracking Platform)
  4.1 Choose backend (flask is the best candidate now.)
  4.2 Choose frontend (twitter bootstrap is the best candidate now.)
  4.3 Graphic of the evolution over time
  4.4 Tagging of false positive
  4.5 Evolution of number of defects (per category or not).
  4.6 Comparison between build's results


5 Advanced heuristics for matching violations.
  Research is needed.
